<h1>
Automated Tournaments
</h1>

<p>
These are the tournaments that are managed by the computer.

<p>
To play in one of these tournaments, simply register and wait.
Once enough players have joined, the tournaments will kick off automatically.
Make sure you've turned on notifications so you don't miss the start!

<h3>Time Control</h3>

<p>
All tournament games use time control.
<p>
If you let a tournament game time out, you will not be allowed to join future tournaments!

<h3>Rounds</h3>

<p>
Tournaments are round-robin, where each player meets every other player.
Everyone plays each side the same number of times.
There may be a few exceptions to these rules in 3+ player games at certain
player counts, but the system attempts to make the pairings as fair as possible.

<p>
With sequential rounds you will only play one game at a time.

<p>
With concurrent rounds you will play several games simultaneously;
but never the same side in more than one game at a time.

<h3>Points</h3>
<p>
Victories are worth 2 points; ties and shared victories are worth 1 point.
The

score is used to break ties.

<h3>Levels</h3>

<p>
Some tournaments may have multiple levels. If you win a tournament at one
level, you may play in the next level (once for each victory).
