# Tournaments

The automated tournaments are managed by the computer.

To play in one of these tournaments, simply register and wait.
Once enough players have joined, the tournaments will kick off automatically.
Make sure you've turned on notifications so you don't miss the start!

## Time Control

All tournament games use time control.

If you let a tournament game time out, you will not be allowed to join future tournaments!

The ban on joining tourmanents is proportional to the number of games you time out.
If you play actively and prove that you can finish more games than you've timed out
you will be allowed to join tournaments again.

## Format

### Rounds

Tournaments are round-robin, where each player meets every other player.
Everyone plays each side the same number of times.
There may be a few exceptions to these rules in 3+ player games at certain
player counts, but the system attempts to make the pairings as fair as possible.

With sequential rounds you will only play one game at a time.

With concurrent rounds you will play several games simultaneously;
but never the same side in more than one game at a time.

### Points

Victories are worth 2 points; ties and shared victories are worth 1 point.

score is used to break ties.

### Levels

Some tournaments may have multiple levels. If you win a tournament at one
level, you may play in the next level (once for each victory).

## Mini Cup

This is a small and fast tournament format for casual play.
The mini cup starts as soon as the required number of players have
entered.
You can play any number of mini cups.

The mini cup games use fast (3+ moves/day) time control.
